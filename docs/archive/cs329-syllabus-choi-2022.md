# Computational Linguistics

As the information age has revolutionized the way human lives, we are experiencing information overload where the amount of data we encounter grows beyond the human capacity.
Although multimedia became a substantial part of big data, text is still the most primitive yet dominating medium.
This interdisciplinary course addresses how to extract information in need from text (Linguistics), make statistical analysis of the extracted information (Quantitative Theory and Methods ), and write computer programs to automate this process (Computer Science).

Prerequisites: CS 171 (CS and LING students) or QTM 220 (QTM students)

## Topical Quizzes

* One quiz will be assigned for every topic to check if you keep up with the materials.
* Quizzes must be submitted individually. Discussions are allowed; however, your work must be original.
* Late submissions within a week will be accepted with the grading penalty of 15%, and will not be accepted once the solutions are discussed in class.

## Project Proposal

* You are expected to:
  * Group a team of 3-4 members ([sign up](https://canvas.emory.edu/courses/96729/groups#tab-16325)).
  * Give a presentation to propose your idea about the final project.
  * Write a proposal that illustrates details about your idea.
* See the [project proposal](project-proposal.md) page for more details.
* Everyone in each group will receive the same grade for the project proposal.

## Final Project

* You are expected to:
  * Give a presentation about your final project.
  * Write a research paper that illustrates details about your work.
* See the [final projects](final-project.md) page for more details.
