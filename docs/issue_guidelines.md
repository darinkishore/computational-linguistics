# Issue Guidelines

It is highly recommended to use [issues](https://github.com/emory-courses/cs329/issues) to communicate with your instructors except for private matters.
When you click the `[New issue]` button, you will see the following 4 templates:

* Lecture
* Quiz
* Project
* Miscellaneous
 
Here are few tips to create a new issue:

* Use one of the templates to create an issue, which automatically labels and assigns it to all instructors. 
* If the issue regards only specific instructors, change the assignment to those instructors only.
* Search for existing issues before creating a new one to minimize redundant posts. 
* The title of the issue should be an indicative summary of your questions/comments.
