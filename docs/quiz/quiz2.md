# Quiz 2: Vector Space Models

## Task 1

* Copy the python file [`quiz2.py`](../../src/quiz/quiz2.py) and put it under the [`quiz`](../../src/quiz/) package in your local project. 
* Update the `cosine()` function such that it takes two sparse vectors and returns its cosine similarity.

## Task 2

* Currently, `quiz2.py` uses TF-IDF scores to generate sparse vectors. Update the `vectorize()` function or/and the `similar_documents` function such that `similar_documents()` would return the most accurate results. 
* Create the report file `quiz2.pdf` under the [`quiz`](../../src/quiz/) package that explains your logic.

## Submission

* Check if `quiz2.py` and `quiz2.pdf` are placed under the `quiz` directory in your repository.
* Commit and push the updates to your GitHub repository.
