# Quiz 2: Vector Space Models

## Task 1

* Create a python file called [`quiz2.py`](../../src/quiz/quiz2.py) under the [`quiz`](../../src/quiz/) package and copy the code.
* Update the `cosine()` function such that it takes two sparse vectors and returns its cosine similarity.

## Task 2

* Currently, `quiz2.py` uses TF-IDF scores to generate sparse vectors. Update the `vectorize()` function or/and the `similar_documents` function such that `similar_documents()` would return the most accurate results. 

## Submission

* Commit and push `quiz2.py` to your GitHub repository.
* Check if `quiz2.py` is placed under the `quiz` directory in your repository.
